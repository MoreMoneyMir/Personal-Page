        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in Guinea, a Franco-phone country in West Africa. I migrated to the United States in 2006, at the age of nine, not speaking a word of English. I was fluent in Mandingo, my tribal language, and three other languages in Guinea: Susu, Mandinka, and French. I was enrolled in ESL from 4th to 7th grade. During those years it seemed like I'd never master English. Fast forward 16 years later, I am fluent in English. But of course, my accent sneaks up with certain words. For example, when I say worm and warm it comes out sounding the same.</p>
        <p>In 2019, I received my Bachelor of Science with a minor in Business Administration and French.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am pursuing a career in tech as a Project Manager or Product Manager. I am also completing the G(Code) House Program, to understand and gain basic coding skills. </p>
        <p>I like to refer to myself as a woman of many passions and talents because I have so many interests and I want to pursue them all. Whether I succeed or fail I want to be able to say I at least went for it.</p>
